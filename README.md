## Description 

This is a website for a ficticious marketing agency. The goal of this exercise was to take the existing code provided to me aand refractor it. These means that any changes I made on the html and css codes would not affect the front end of the website. No matter how many changes I made, the front end had to look the same at the end as it did when I first started working in it. The end goal was to take a "broken" website and make it accessible
